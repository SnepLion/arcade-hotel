# Arcade and Vending Automation System

## Description
This is a tailored project for Luz y Fuerza Hotel in Villa Giardino, Córdoba Province, Argentina, designed precisely to meet their specifications and expectations.

Long story short, this hotel has several Vending Machines, but the company that used to operate them went bankrupt. On top of that, coins in Argentina are extremely rare, and wouldn't make up for the price of any product. Now, they've been sitting there for half a decade. On the other hand, this hotel lacks any kind of entertainment in-site, especifically for rainy or cold days. The company's management asked us for a posible solution for this and we came up with the idea of an application for users to use both Vending Machines and custom machines with Arcade games emulators.
